# üìà Financial Data Analysis Project

Welcome to this repository! This project showcases a hands-on approach to extracting, processing, and visualizing financial stock and revenue data using Python. It's a journey through practical data science skills, from fetching raw data off the web to presenting clear insights through graphs.

## ‚ú® What's Inside?

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that guide you through key steps in financial data analysis:

* **üìä Stock Data Fundamentals:** Dive into how to acquire historical stock prices for major companies like **Tesla (TSLA)** and **GameStop (GME)** using the `yfinance` library. Learn to extract, clean, and prepare this time-series data for analysis.
* **üï∏Ô∏è Web Scraping Financials:** Discover the power of web scraping with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. This notebook demonstrates how to programmatically extract financial revenue data directly from web pages, tackling challenges like HTML parsing and data cleaning (e.g., removing commas and dollar signs).
* **üìà Integrated Analysis & Visualization:** The core of the project where we bring it all together! Combine the extracted stock price and revenue data to create insightful visualizations. Learn to plot historical share prices alongside revenue trends to understand company performance.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Pandas:** For robust data manipulation and analysis, especially with DataFrames.
* **yfinance:** A powerful library for fetching historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
* **Requests:** For making HTTP requests to download web page content.
* **BeautifulSoup4:** For parsing HTML and XML documents, making it easy to extract data.
* **Plotly / Matplotlib** (or similar, used by `make_graph`): For creating interactive and static data visualizations.

## üí° How to Get Started

To run these notebooks and explore the code yourself:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub details.)

2.  **Install dependencies:** It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas yfinance beautifulsoup4 requests plotly matplotlib # Add any other libraries you used
    ```

3.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Your browser will open, displaying the Jupyter interface. You can then navigate to and open each notebook (`.ipynb` file) to run the cells.
